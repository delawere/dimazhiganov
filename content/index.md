# Hi! I'm Dima.

Iâ€™m a frontend developer at [Exante](https://exante.eu/), an investment company.

I have more than six years of experience in frontend development, working with various frameworks, libraries, and tools. I have successfully completed multiple projects for different clients and industries, such as [Kaspersky](https://www.kaspersky.com/) and [QIWI](https://qiwi.com/), delivering user-friendly, responsive, and secure web solutions. I am always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate with other professionals to create innovative and impactful web applications.
